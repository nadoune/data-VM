2,"Estimates are subject to sampling error. This error can be expressed as a standard error. All estimates contained in this table have been assigned a letter value to indicate the quality of the estimate, as measured by the standard error (expressed as a percentage). A = Excellent (0.00% to less than 2.50%), B = Very good (2.50% to less than 5.00%), C = Good (5.00% to less than 7.50%), D = Acceptable (7.50% to less than 10.00%), E = Use with caution (10.00% to less than 15.00%), F = Too unreliable to be published (Greater than or equal to 15%, data are suppressed)."
3,"Figures may not add to 100% due to rounding."
4,"This includes all employees who would receive a Statement of Remuneration Paid (T4). Excluded from number of employees are business owners, contract workers and other personnel who would not receive a T4."
5,"Majority ownership is defined at 51% or more. Majority-ownership was self-reported for private sector businesses only."
6,"The term LGBTQ2 refers to persons who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and/or two-spirited."
7,"Respondents were asked if the business or organization identified as being majority owned (51% or more) by any visible minority. If so, the business or organization was asked to identify all visible minority types that made up majority ownership. Figures may not represent majority ownership by a specific visible minority."
8,"The results in this table are based on the survey that was in collection from April 1 to May 6, 2022, and respondents were asked what their expectations would be over the next three-month period. As a result, those three months could range from April 1 to August 6, 2022, depending on when the business responded."
